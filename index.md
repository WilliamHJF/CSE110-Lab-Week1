My name is **Jianfan Huo**, and you can also call me **William**. I am a Computer Science student who is going to graduate from the 
> University of California, San Diego in 2022.<br/>
I see myself as a relentless `problem-solver`, and Iâ€™m always looking for a new challenge.In the previous team project, my teammates thought that I was a serious, careful and patient person, so I was mainly responsible for debugging and writing the main contents of the program, like main function determining the framework of the whole project.<br/> And you can find more info about me at my
